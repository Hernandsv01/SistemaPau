# Description
This is an app designed to manage and organize weekly classes and students with their respective information.

It was created using 100% Java with the help of NetBeans's JFrame editor for the visual part.

# Set up and run
It's not really meant to be run as this was my first ever big project and I moved on to building other things as I progressed in my learning path.

In case you still want to try it, it is run like this:
- Open up a terminal
- Go to the dist folder
- Execute java -jar "Proyecto.jar" 
A mariadb driver and a running MySQL database are needed for the features to actually do something.
