# Description
    This is an app designed to manage and organize weekly classes and students with their respective information.
    It was created using 100% Java with the help of NetBeans's JFrame editor for the visual part.

# Setup and run
    It's not really meant to be run as this was my first ever big project
    In case you still want to try it, a mariadb driver is needed and a running MySQL database (it can be run without this things but none of the features will work)
    Open up a terminal, go to the dist folder and execute java -jar "Proyecto.jar"
